		<h2> James Newman  </h2>
	<p>
		<p class="paragraph"> My name is James Newman i'm 27 and i'm from basking ridge, NJ. I moved to Weehawken with two of my friends over the summer. I enjoy snowboarding, music, good food and spending time outdoors. I also love cars and spending time with my girlfriend. I have some backround in coding due to me having my AA in computer science and have always had a passion for computers and I find the language itself very intresting. I have one sister a mom and a dad, and no pets but I want a dog. <p/>
